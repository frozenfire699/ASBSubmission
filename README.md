# test-angular
A website to capture NBA ASB event league entries and display final results
#Motivation
I wanted to use my learning of Angular JS and put it to practice to help solve a league problem

#What does it do?
1) Allow a team to submit their entry for a league specific event
2) Display results

#How to run it?
#Locally
1) Create a Web Project named ASB in Eclipse
2) Move the index.html, js folder ( along with contents ) and pages folder (along with contents ) inside WebContent folder
3) Run as Java application on the application server

#Enhancements
Coming soon....
